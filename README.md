• Conducted in-depth EDA on a hotel booking dataset, uncovering insights to enhance business strategies by analyzing booking patterns, revenue trends, and customer behaviors.
• The analysis revealed that bookings peaked in 2016, with the highest revenue in 2017; identified highest daily earnings from Transient customers and maximum revenue from contract customers; pinpointed high booking cancellation ratio and suggested mitigation measures.
• Created five new metrics and identified three key factors affecting booking cancellations, providing actionable insights. Utilized various visualizations to enhance data visibility and stakeholder understanding. Guided targeted marketing strategies and optimized revenue generation.

• Clustered 7,787 rows and 12 columns using K-Means (n=5) and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (n=11); achieved higher 
Silhouette Score with K-Means (0.6).
• Executed text preprocessing on textual data; utilized TFIDF vectorizer, scaled with Standard Scaler, and reduced dimensions with PCA algorithm (n=3).
• Developed a recommender system to recommend similar shows based on the input show name.
